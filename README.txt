RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

Any text in quotation marks indicates a command to enter into the terminal.
These should, of course, be entered WITHOUT the quotation marks.

1) Run the command "make client server".
2) Open a second terminal.
3) In one terminal run "./server". This is the record keeper.
4) In the second terminal run "./client". This is the administrator program.
5) The program is now running.
6) To close the programs, press the CONTROL+C key combination in each
   terminal. This will kill both programs.

It is IMPORTANT that the SERVER is run before the CLIENT.
Please follow the above steps IN ORDER.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROGRAM OPERATION:

The ADMINISTRATOR PROGRAM will prompt the user with a list of commands.
Each command is associated with a number.
Enter a number into the console and press ENTER/RETURN to select the
associated command.

After selecting a command, you will be prompted to enter some data. You will
be told what type of data to enter (Employee number, name, etc.)
When entering data, please input data of the APPROPRIATE TYPE:

For EMPLOYEE NUMBERS and SALARIES, please only enter an INTEGER NUMBER.
For NAMES, please only enter an ALPHABETICAL STRING.

Whenever a request is made, the RECORD-KEEPER program will print out an
updated version of its records, and the client will print out any data
that it received (if it requested any).
