---- SERVER ----
   STARTUP
   - Server starts up and registers the the two message queues that it and the
   client use to communicate with one another
   
   LISTENING
   - Server listens for messages of the CMD type on the `admin -> server` message
   queue.

   - Once it recieves a CMD type message it listens for a DATA type message, which
   contains the piece of data required for that specific message type (IE full record
   for an INSERT command, just the employee number for a name lookup)

   - Upon recieving a message the server checks the command element of the message
   structure and depending on the command issued by the admin will Insert/Search/Delete
   in its employee records based on the record elements present in the DATA message

   - If the command was INSERT or DELETE then the server goes back to LISTENING state,
   otherwise it continues

   - For all other commands the server searches through the records for elements matching
   the data given in the DATA message (ie. Client gives server an employee number and asks
   for the name of that employee, the server will try to match the given employee number
   to one in its records). This can be a single match for commands 2-5, and multiple matches
   for command 6 (check all in department)

   - The server pushed all matching records into the `server -> client` message queue, and
   then pushed a LEN type message indicating how many records were sent to the client.

   - Server prints its new internal state (record store) and returns to LISTENING

   EXIT
   - When user presses CTRL-C the server closes the message queues and exits

--- CLIENT ---

   STARTUP
   - The client registers itself to the two messages queues it uses to communicate with
   the server

   PROMPT
   - The client will display a prompt to the user asking for a number (1-7) to be entered,
   corresponding to the 7 different commands laid out in the assignment
  
   - Upon recieving the command the client will then prompt the user for the fields required
   by that specific command (ie. Full record for 1|Insert, or just an employee number for 2|get name)

   - The client will then push a CMD type message to the `admin -> server` message queue, as well as
   a DATA type message containing the record with the appropriate fields filled.

   - If the user issued an Insert or Delete command, the client goes back to PROMPT

   - The client then listens on the `Server -> client` message queue for a LEN type message indicating how
   many records the client will need to recieve from the server. In most cases this will be 1 or 0 (because
   most commands will only match a single employee record), however check full department can return any
   number of employee records

   - Once the client knows how many records to pull in, it reads DATA type messages from the `server -> client`
   message queue up to the limit specific in the LEN message and displays the resulting data to the user via
   a print function.
